There is a client.
The client can have any number of cards.
The card has three fields - cvv code, card number and the amount on the card.
Display a message on the screen indicating how many identical cards the client has.
The field with the amount value on the card should not participate in the comparison.
I.e. two multiples with the same cvv codes and numbers, but different amounts are considered the same.
Provide various options for the output message - for example, the client does not have any cards at all,
the client does not have the same cards and other possible situations.
